Missing functionality (major):
- Modify app.js to be able to handle multiple calculations. Requests should include a token, and the same token can be used to check on the status of a calculation.
- Once the backend is working, add the ability to calculate loss.

To do (minor):
- Write unit tests and integration tests
- Add "What's this?" documentation to the UI wherever things are unclear
- Make global collapse page look nicer
- Add the ability to create custom fragility functions on the Structure page
- Add the ability to view EDPs on a graph together on the EDP page
- Add graphs of the fragility functions on the component page
